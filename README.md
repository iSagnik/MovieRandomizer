#MovieRandomizer
<br>
<br>
Python Executable File:
<br>
randomizer.exe
<br>

Run this file and select the 'movies.csv' file in the docs folder to get movie suggestions. You may use your own files as long as it has the same number of data columns. If you're file does not have 16 headings make placeholder elements. I will fix this in a future update.
